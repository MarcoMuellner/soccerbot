## Features

Below you can see the full list of features available for soccerbot.
On how to use these features, consult the [Documentation](documentation.md)
page, which will give you all the commands usable.

### User side features
* _All official FIFA competitions are available_: You can add any
competition/league you like with the soccerbot. This ranges from the
_Lliga Nacional_ in Andorra to the _Premier League_ in England to
the _SÃ©rie A_ in Brazil
* _Automatic creation of channels_: For each competition you want
the bot to monitor, it will create a channel accordingly. The
channelname will follow the pattern _live-LEAGUE_. You can also
specify the channel the bot will use for its updates, as well as
the category it will put it. It is also capable of assigning roles
to channels, so that only users with this role can see it.
* _Live updates of games_: For all specified leagues, the bot will
post nicely formatted updates to the channel this league is assigned
to. It also supports emojis (though only custom emojis added to the
server) and you can change the update texts without changing the code
itself. More information on this, again on the [Documentation](documentation.md)
page. If you correctly configured the reddit access of the bot, it will
also be able to post links to those goals, if it can find any.
* _Listing of competitions for a given country_: Ever wondered
whats the name of the league in Pakistan? Soccerbot allows this,
and has a specific command to list competitions for a given country.
The same command can be used for the Federations (UEFA for example).
* _Current scores for given leagues/teams_: Soccerbot also provides
you with a command that can show you the current scores within a given
league. This command is generally available for all competitions, if
a competition is specified. Within a designated channel of the bot, it
will list the current scores within the league designated to this channel.
* _List the topscorers for a given league_: Using the topScorer command,
you can call down the current topScorer for any league data is available.
This info also includes goals scored via header and penalty.
* _List the current standing of a given league_: You can call down
any standing for any league in the world. Ever wondered who leads the
table in Lithuania? Well, now you can!
* _Get player information_: The bot also provides a command that can show
you information on a given player, including goals scored, contract time,
yellow cards, red cards. All info is for the current season.

## Admin features
* _Full controls via Discord_: Updating, restarting, stopping. All of
those things are fully controllable via the Discord server itself.
* _User level control_: It can be benefitial to give only certain users
access to certain features. This is also controllable via the bot. You
can set a certain userlevel for each user. If you are a userlevel > 5
you will also be able to see the user levels for each command using
the help command.

These features will be of course expanded in the future.
