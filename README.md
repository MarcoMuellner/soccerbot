# The soccerbot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/muma7490/soccerbot.svg?branch=master)]

_Introducing soccerbot: A discord bot that automatically creates Match
channels, posts live updates and many more things to come._

## Information

All information on this project is available under
[soccerbot.eu](https://soccerbot.eu). It includes all currently active
[features](http://soccerbot.eu/features/),
[commando documentation](http://soccerbot.eu/documentation/) as well as
an [installation guide](http://soccerbot.eu/quickstart/). This is the
central point for all information on the bot and will be kept up to

## Help

Before asking for any help, please refer to the website above. If this
doesn't help you, there are two points where you can receive help:

* _Discord_: There is a discord server for this bot, available
[here](https://discord.gg/wGDvGR9). There you can also see the latest
experimental features of the bot. Please use the #help channel for any
help.
